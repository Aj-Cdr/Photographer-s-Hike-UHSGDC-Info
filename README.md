# Photographer-s-Hike-UHSGDC-Info

Game name: The photographer’s hike (might change it) or A photographer’s hike

Game idea: It would be a short game (eg. a short hike). The player would be in 3rd person and would have a camera. Their goal in life is to climb (insert mountain name) while taking pictures along the way. There will be specific points where the player must go on routes to find the perfect place to take a picture. At that place, there would be a sign. They would have to take 5 or so photos in each layer (like a regular mountain). The genre really could be anything, it could be a platformer, or an open-world adventure to find the picture places sort of like pokemon snap.

There would be 3 layers, not including the peak. At the peak, the player will take the last picture and the game will end. The three-layer would be separated by different camps (checkpoints(sort of like this):

The camps would also have other fellow climbers taking and drinking hot chocolate etc.

After each camp you would need to do a minigame of climbing up a bit of the mountain, getting increasingly harder after each camp. It would be sort of like the indoor rock climbing walls except with a bunch of obstacles.

The mountain would probably be in a more tropical area with the first layer having a lot of jungle animals: monkeys, tigers, etc. The second layer would be more of a transitional layer between the first and second layers, it would be more pale green, and have some different animals, and probably more birds, the third layer would be a snowy place because it is very far up.


*The game should not take too long so having fewer pictures to take in each layer is ok

The player when taking a picture would also go into first person to take the picture in the specific spot. 

Gameplay: The photographer would be looking for these perfect picture-taking spots and would have to past obstacles along the way, for example, a pop-up or a lion roar would come up on your screen saying that a mountain lion is near you (just chose a random animal), and you would have to hide or use different objects to scare away the animal. Other obstacles could be trees in your way, big dangerous gaps. As you progress through the game the snow and wind will increase making it harder to avoid animals and different obstacles. A lot more ideas could be added from the start to when the player finds the perfect place to take a photo to make the game more enjoyable and keep the player interested e.g. adding more minigames or encounters with wildlife or other hikers

**I guess it could also just be a platformer and at the end of the level is the perfect picture taking spot as well**



Art: 3d graphic, or pixel 3d graphics, it could be 2d if 3d is too complicated but preferably 3d, or isometric 2d graphics, or 2d graphics (whatever is easiest)

Sound: Idk, like mountain vibes, ambient noises, wind whooshing, nothing really special, probably just a bunch of tiny sound effects, like birds calling the background randomly, etc.

This is not a game design doc, but a game idea so lots of things could be added or removed.
